# ToyPack
ToyPack is my personal Minecraft Resource Pack. It uses textures from many other texture packs (see attributions), and some of my own tweaks.

**ToyPack is intended for use with the Programmer Art texture back as a fallback.** It is recommended that you do this, or else suffer having the ToyPack textures, which are based on the old style, alongside the new Jappa textures. It'll look awful; don't do it.

## Attributions

## Changelog
New features in this Update (1.13.1): This update brings the pack to work with 1.19.3, alongside a few new features and bugfixes from the original 1.19 port.
+ Added old Door sound to work on wooden Trapdoors too
+ Added directional indicators for Observers, Droppers, and Dispensers
* Updated Creative inventory tabs to support the new 1.19.3 changes
* Fixed Hopper break particle
* Renamed "Red Dye" to "Rose Red" (I don't know if this was an MCPE-exclusive old name or if JE had it too but to this day it's still what I call Red Dye)
* Fixed Piston face texture to be in the oCd style again
+ Added Stone texture to the top of Furnaces (Super super old ToyPack feature I brought back through the magic of stealing JSONs from the vanilla assets)
+ Added Sticky Piston side textures for the side of the head, making it easier to see what type of Piston a Piston is without having to see the face
- Removed Iron Golem crack textures
- Removed Lena Raine BGM (The music discs and stuff are still there)
* Changed Netherite gear (tools, and armour sprites and models) to be based on the Programmer Art Diamond gear textures, but desaturated and darkened
	* Fixed Netherite armour model textures to show up correctly in 1.19+

New features in this Update (1.13): This update is both a feature update and a port to 1.19 (from 1.6.4).
* Fixed item enchantment glint to use the colour purple (In older versions, a black-white gradient was used and was hardcoded to be tinted purple, but in newer versions, the texture is purple by default and the game no longer tints the texture. This caused the enchantment glint to be a bright white in modern versions using the old texture)
* Version number in the inventory now goes over two lines, as in Survival mode there's a Recipe Book in the way, and in Creative mode the armour slots have been centered, taking up space that used to be occupied by a single line of text
- Removed monochromatic lighing, as it is not supported in Sodium or Iris, and I no longer use OptiFine
+ All Chests, Trapped Chests, and Ender Chests now have a proper, consistent 2D lock
* Updated Steve texture to support the new skin format in-game
+ Added frostbite hearts and attack indicators to the icon set
* Fixed Statistics menu sort order arrows to match all other arrow buttons in-game (they were previously not darkened)
* Fixed sounds and directory structure in `/assets/minecraft/sounds/` to the new 1.19 tree
+ Added sounds for the now "old" XP gain and Ã—5 level up sound effects
* Optimised Redstone Dust rendering
- Removed oars from boats (Mangrove Boats are a TODO, once Vanilla Tweaks adds a Retro/Old Planks boat texture for Mangrove Boats)
+ Re-added the \[now outdated\] pack.png icon for texture packs with no known icon (In recent versions this has been replaced by a 3D Cobblestone block)
+ Added an old-style ice textures for Packed Ice and Blue Ice
+ Added old-Netherrack-based textures for the Nylium blocks
* Poppies have been renamed to Roses
* "Teracotta" is back to "Hardened Clay"
* "Dirt Path" is back to "Grass Path"
* Zombified Piglins have been renamed back to Zombie Pigmen, alongside having their old texture back
+ Buttons go blue on hover rather than a white outline
+ Added inverted Daylight Detector texture (in the oCd style)
+ Hoppers now have arrows which point which way they're facing (No arrow appears if the Hopper is facing down)
+ Added missing oCd-style textures for the inside and front of the Pistons
+ Added Mutton sprites
* Beds have 2D sprites, like they used to
+ Added old-style plank textures for the Nylium plank blocks, and Mangrove Planks
+ Added HD banner patterns for shields
+ Added old-style Netherite armour sprites and textures when worn
+ Added uniform ores for Deepslate Ores, Nether Gold Ore, and Nether Quartz Ore
+ Added the 1.9-1.11 old Shulker colours instead of the 1.12+ colours
+ Added custom model to make an off-hand Shield lower down on the screen

New features in this Update (1.12.1):
* Resized Map texture to fit behind the map drawing, so that there's a background behind it, but not when the map is fully loaded. (This helps in 1.7+ (not adding support for that just yet) for how Maps expand fully over an Item Frame
