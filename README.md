# ToyPack
ToyPack is my personal Minecraft r1.6.4 Resource Pack. It uses textures from many other texture packs (see attributions), and some of my own tweaks.

## Attributions
* FVdisco's oCd (Some redstone components and torches)
* Vanilla Tweaks (Dark inventory, \[some\] natural blocks, denoised bedrock, some old sounds, some quieter sounds)
* CodeCrafted (Redstone wire, breaking animation)

## Changelog
New features in this Update (1.12):
- Removed some non-food item sprites' black outlines.

+ Re-added(?) old Lava textures.
* Removed CodeCrafted Wool textures. I replaced them with some self-made denoised ones based off of the original Minecraft textures.
