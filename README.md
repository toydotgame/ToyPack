# ToyPack
ToyPack is my personal Minecraft Resource Pack. It uses textures from many other texture packs (see attributions), and some of my own tweaks, fixes, and textures.

**ToyPack is intended for use with the Programmer Art texture back as a fallback.** All ToyPack textures are based off or designed to look like Programmer Art textures, and thus don't work well with the new Jappa textures.

## Changelog
New features in this Update (1.13.6): A major update with a lot of features I've planned but just let pile up instead of implementing. This is probably going to be the last update before Minecraft Release 1.20, where I'll probably bump the minor version of this pack from 1.13 to 1.14.
+ New Recipe Book button that appears invisible until you hover over it, displaying a "?" icon.
+ Added a border to frosted Ice (created by Frost Walker boots) in the style of the Glass block border.
+ Added deep fried variants of the Fox hit and death sounds.
+ Overwrote the drown, berry bush, burn, and freeze hurt sounds to all be the normal old hurt sound.
+ Added slight Ice overlay to Powder Snow.
- Removed the console edition Snowball texture. (This is another one of the 1.0 ToyPack features from long, long ago. RIP)
+ Added Programmer Art style Powder Snow Bucket with the old Snowball and Bucket textures.
+ Added Programmer Art style Campfires, with old flames, smoke, logs, and ash.
* Fixed the GUI titles of the Loom, Grindstone, Cartography Table, Barrel, Smithing Table, chest Boat, and the Advancements screen to have white text to match the dark UI.
* Fixed an issue with the dark Smithing Table GUI not showing up on 1.19.4+ versions of the game (causes an incompatibility with 1.19.3 and below, unfortunately).
- Removed the Lapis slot hint from the Enchanting Table.
- Removed Boat oar sounds.
+ Renamed "Dandelion" to "Flower"
+ Added old planks for the Mangrove and Mangrove chest Boats.
+ Added Programmer Art styled Boat and chest Boat sprites.
+ Added Beta styled grass, where the side colour of the grass does not change with the biome colourmap.
+ Added ore borders for Budding Amethyst blocks.
+ Added `age: 25` Kelp marker texture.
+ Added power level text for all Redstone wires with a power level above 0.
+ Added Iron Block-styled texture for Netherite Blocks, updating it to look like the other valuable storage blocks.
+ Added Note Block pitch indicators.
+ Added Alpha style panorama overlay, just giving you a dirt background on the title screen.
+ Added transparent system message toasts (namely the alert for servers with disabled chat reporting).
	+ Changed description text for the secure chat disabled alert to read "This server has chat reporting disabled"
* Changed Dispenser/Hopper directional textures to be Programmer Art-styled.
* Changed Observer powered state indicator textures to be Programmer Art-styled (not using the 1.11 snapshot for the front of the Observer though).
+ Added Programmer Art-styled Axolotl and Tadpole buckets.
* Fixed existing Programmer Art bucket textures for the buckets of Pufferfish, Salmon, Cod, and Tropical Fish.
+ Renamed and retextured Cod and Cod-related items to "Fish." (Yet to retexture the physical entity to be blue instead of brown, but everything else looks and says "Fish" like pre-1.13 had)
+ Fixed Z fighting of Iron Bars bases.
+ Re-added Ilmango Golden Apples (this is another ancient feature I removed in the Great De-obnixification update I believe, but I wanted it back)
+ Added pre-1.18 Stipped Dark Oak Log texture (applied to Wood variant as well).
* Fixed enchantment glints to work in 1.19.4+.
+ Added pumpkinblur styled freezing overlay.
+ Added darker Dark Oak Leaves.
+ Added shorter Tall Grass.
+ Added alternate White Dye texture, because I didn't like the normal one.
+ Added transparent Recipe Book GUI.
+ Added pixel consistent XP orbs.
* Fixed Nylium wood trapdoors to have the same sounds as all the other wood trapdoors.
+ Added Stone Bricks-styled Quartz Bricks.
+ Added Blue Rose from MCPE Alpha days, replacing the Blue Orchid.
+ Added Programmer Art textures for the background to the Advancements screens.
+ Added Bow shoot and Arrow land sounds for the Trident.
- Removed Trident Loytalty return sound effect.
+ Changed all "Spawn Egg" item names to say "Spawn \<Mob\>," like it used to once upon a time.

New features in this Update (1.13.5): Patching some stuff and experimenting with some things that I've never really used before much in texture packs.
+ Made the survival mode inventory transparent, including status effect box things.
	* Changed the hotbar number hints in the survival inventory to be white, to match the rest of the text in there. The rest of the containers still have their old hotbar hint colours because they are not transparent.
	* Made the brewing guide from the last update transparent as well, as it's quite large.
* Fixed the long-standing issue of the Z fighting that occurs with the Redstone dot texture, which is on a lot of other Redstone Dust textures, causing them to fight and overall look bad when you look closely. Redstone wires now work as intended in all configurations.
* Fixed another long-standing issue where I neglected to add white text to the GUI with the dark theme, making most text hard to read. It was kinda a "_It's not a bug, it's a feature!_" type of issue, but I've given in and fixed it now.
	+ As a consequence, the category names in the creative inventory are all light blue to match the look in the tooltip. Having the category names be white in the GUI makes them white in the tooltip as well and it doesn't look good.
+ Added inventory indicators to Waxed Copper blocks, similar to the indicators on Monster Eggs.
+ Removed the inside of the Scaffolding texture to make it easier to see through.
+ Added level indicators for:
	+ Cauldrons (Powder Snow, Lava, and Water types)
	+ Beehives and Bee Nests
+ Added Ore outlines for all ores (normal, Grimstone, and Nether variants all included).

New features in this Update (1.13.4): Preparing for 1.19.4 and 1.20 textures soon! New Boats and enchantment glint details will need to be worked out. Small 1.19.3 feature update for now:
+ Added old Villager textures taken from StupidUglE123 on PMC. They're not perfectly Vanilla (see: unemployed and zombie villager textures), but they do have the old textures and remove all the new stuff that I don't like.
* Fixed the Chest closing sound sometimes being the new one.
* Reduced the number of splash sounds from 9/18 to 5/18 making a noise.
+ Renamed most "Block of" blocks to just be "\<Material\> Block."
+ Replaced the Cod and Cooked Cod textures with the old Fish textures, and renamed their items to say "Fish" instead of "Cod" as well.
* Replaced the Glowstone texture (which was actually the activated Redstone Lamp texture from CodeCrafted) with a recoloured Sea Lantern texture I found on PMC.
* Removed some more item hints in the Horse and Brewing Stand GUI. The Blaze Powder hint in the Brewing Stand GUI is kept but I didn't want the bottles there because they look bad with Splash Potions in the slots.
+ Added a brewing guide to the Brewing Stand GUI.
+ Removed the text saying "Inventory" from all GUIs. This is so that the hints in the Brewing Stand don't overlap, but also it cleans up some other interfaces where it really doesn't need to be said.

New features in this Update (1.13.3): Another small batch of new features and retro-ification! (Alongside a couple bugfixes)
+ Added old Gravel step sound ([Credit to Lyann's _Legacy Edition_ resource pack](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/legacy-edition-1-15-2/) for the sound, but I'm not giving a full arrtibution because it is just a stock old Minecraft sound file – this is just where I got it from because I had it at hand)
+ Added old-style cast Fishing Rod texture (the Stick)
* Fixed Furnaces so that lit Furnaces also have the Stone block top and bottom texture, not just unlit ones
+ Changed "You Died!" text on the kill screen to "Game over!" like in Alpha.
+ Changed "Green Dye" to "Cactus Green" (similar to what I did with Rose Red)
+ Changed "Wheat Seeds" to "Seeds" because #GoldenAgeMinecraft amirite
+ Added markers to monster egg variants of blocks in the inventory (does not affect the placed block)
+ Replaced the menu click with the Legacy Console Edition click
+ Changed "Block of Redstone" to "Redstone Block" because honestly who calls it "Block of Redstone?"
+ Readded old Sponge texture (which I thought was still in the pack, but turns out it wasnt)
+ Added old-style Netherite and Copper Ingots (based off of the Programmer Art Iron Ingot sprite)
+ Added oarless, old-style planks Chest Boats
	+ Removed the oars from Mangrove Boats and Chest Boats, but left in the new Mangrove Planks texture instead of an old one because idk, I just feel like the Mangrove things are new and maybe a bit of non-Programmer Art texturing makes them a bit more unique
+ Renamed Deepslate and its many other derivatives and blocks with its name to their snapshot name: "Grimstone" (including the ores). Honestly it was cooler
+ Renamed the Infested blocks to Monster Eggs like they used to be because I'm not used to it so why bother _ever_ being used to it?

New features in this Update (1.13.2): Yet another feature update, with some slight optimisations to how I mod sounds in the future.
* Fixed wooden Doors sometimes doing a few of the new open/close sounds even though the Door sounds directory has all the sounds replaced
+ Replaced Nylium (Crimson + Warped) Door sounds to match the wooden Door sounds
+ Replaced all Fence Gate sounds to have the old Door sounds
+ Added the old Stonecutter model and textures from Pocket Edition. Unfortunately, due to technical limitations of Minecraft resource packs, I can't change the block's hitbox
- Removed the oCd Farmland texture
+ Added back the old Button sounds for wooden and Nylium buttons
+ Added back the old Pressure Plate sounds for wooden and Nylium Pressure Plates, but I left the Weighted ones alone so that they're unique
+ Added a uniform Copper Ore (stone) texture, as it was previously missing
+ Replaced the Netherrack walk, place, and break sounds with their old Stone-based sounds
+ Renamed "Sugar Cane" to "Reeds." I think I've done this before and didn't like it, but I've decided to give it another shot anyway
+ Removed the 1.13 water ambience sounds
+ Removed the 1.13 water swim, splash, and fall sounds, and replaced them with the very old compressed-sounding water splash sounds from the Beta(?) days

New features in this Update (1.13.1): This update brings the pack to work with 1.19.3, alongside a few new features and bugfixes from the original 1.19 port.
+ Added old Door sound to work on wooden Trapdoors too
+ Added directional indicators for Observers, Droppers, and Dispensers
* Updated Creative inventory tabs to support the new 1.19.3 changes
* Fixed Hopper break particle
* Renamed "Red Dye" to "Rose Red" (I don't know if this was an MCPE-exclusive old name or if JE had it too but to this day it's still what I call Red Dye)
* Fixed Piston face texture to be in the oCd style again
+ Added Stone texture to the top of Furnaces (Super super old ToyPack feature I brought back through the magic of stealing JSONs from the vanilla assets)
+ Added Sticky Piston side textures for the side of the head, making it easier to see what type of Piston a Piston is without having to see the face
- Removed Iron Golem crack textures
- Removed Lena Raine BGM (The music discs and stuff are still there)
* Changed Netherite gear (tools, and armour sprites and models) to be based on the Programmer Art Diamond gear textures, but desaturated and darkened
	* Fixed Netherite armour model textures to show up correctly in 1.19+

New features in this Update (1.13): This update is both a feature update and a port to 1.19 (from 1.6.4).
* Fixed item enchantment glint to use the colour purple (In older versions, a black-white gradient was used and was hardcoded to be tinted purple, but in newer versions, the texture is purple by default and the game no longer tints the texture. This caused the enchantment glint to be a bright white in modern versions using the old texture)
* Version number in the inventory now goes over two lines, as in Survival mode there's a Recipe Book in the way, and in Creative mode the armour slots have been centered, taking up space that used to be occupied by a single line of text
- Removed monochromatic lighing, as it is not supported in Sodium or Iris, and I no longer use OptiFine
+ All Chests, Trapped Chests, and Ender Chests now have a proper, consistent 2D lock
* Updated Steve texture to support the new skin format in-game
+ Added frostbite hearts and attack indicators to the icon set
* Fixed Statistics menu sort order arrows to match all other arrow buttons in-game (they were previously not darkened)
* Fixed sounds and directory structure in `/assets/minecraft/sounds/` to the new 1.19 tree
+ Added sounds for the now "old" XP gain and ×5 level up sound effects
* Optimised Redstone Dust rendering
- Removed oars from boats (Mangrove Boats are a TODO, once Vanilla Tweaks adds a Retro/Old Planks boat texture for Mangrove Boats)
+ Re-added the \[now outdated\] pack.png icon for texture packs with no known icon (In recent versions this has been replaced by a 3D Cobblestone block)
+ Added an old-style ice textures for Packed Ice and Blue Ice
+ Added old-Netherrack-based textures for the Nylium blocks
* Poppies have been renamed to Roses
* "Teracotta" is back to "Hardened Clay"
* "Dirt Path" is back to "Grass Path"
* Zombified Piglins have been renamed back to Zombie Pigmen, alongside having their old texture back
+ Buttons go blue on hover rather than a white outline
+ Added inverted Daylight Detector texture (in the oCd style)
+ Hoppers now have arrows which point which way they're facing (No arrow appears if the Hopper is facing down)
+ Added missing oCd-style textures for the inside and front of the Pistons
+ Added Mutton sprites
* Beds have 2D sprites, like they used to
+ Added old-style plank textures for the Nylium plank blocks, and Mangrove Planks
+ Added HD banner patterns for shields
+ Added old-style Netherite armour sprites and textures when worn
+ Added uniform ores for Deepslate Ores, Nether Gold Ore, and Nether Quartz Ore
+ Added the 1.9-1.11 old Shulker colours instead of the 1.12+ colours
+ Added custom model to make an off-hand Shield lower down on the screen

New features in this Update (1.12.1):
* Resized Map texture to fit behind the map drawing, so that there's a background behind it, but not when the map is fully loaded. (This helps in 1.7+ (not adding support for that just yet) for how Maps expand fully over an Item Frame
