I have yoinked the health.png from assets/defaultskins/default/ from the OG Damage Indicators Mod. I took the Health Indicators TXF texture, first scaled it from the original 128x128 to 256x256 (i.e. 2x pixel res.), then vertically made the resolution 1024 (4x the 2x already) in order to fit more detail.

Then I scaled the health.png from 64x32 to 252x40 (40 comes from the 4x2x4=32 px new height of the "Default" TXF indicator bar, then plus 4px (half the horizontal borders above and below) for more detail.
